# Buffalo-Data-Project-1-
Web application that visualizes data from the Open Data Buffalo site.

This project involves using JSON, queries, and AJAX to retrieve data from https://data.buffalony.gov/. The data includes the date, status of the car, and location. (tow date, tow description, and police_district). A simple HTML webpage is used to display data (using pie, line, and scatter graphs). As a web framework, the Python Bottle package was used to develop this simple web application.
